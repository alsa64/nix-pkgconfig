# nix-pkgconfig

This is a wrapper for `pkg-config` allowing nix-unaware applications (e.g.
`cabal-install`) to use packages from nixpkgs.

## Usage with cabal-install

```
cabal new-build --with-pkg-config=nix-pkgconfig/pkg-config
```

Note that some packages respect the `pkg-config` flag to enable
`pkg-config`-based native library discovery.  The included
`cabal.project.local` includes some `project` stanzas to enable the necessary
flags with cabal `new-build`.
